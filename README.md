# Fake-News-Detection
 This project builds a Fake News Detection system using NLP and Machine Learning. News articles are preprocessed using stopword removal and stemming, then converted into numerical features using TF-IDF. A Logistic Regression model is trained to classify articles as Real (0) or Fake (1), achieving accurate predictions on test data.
